### Post-transcriptional Network Modeling 
<br>

  Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a central role in the regulation of gene expression, with protein levels partly determined by various features within target mRNAs. Emerging evidence indicates that most individual mRNAs contain multiple regulatory elements. This underscores the need for efficient bioinformatic tools that can capture and integrate multiple mRNA features to assess both their independent and combined impact on the proteome. Here, we present postNet, a tool that enables in silico identification, integration, and modeling of mRNA features that influence post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression at a transcriptome-wide scale. Although geared towards studies of post-transcriptional regulation, postNet is highly customizable and can, in principle, be applied in a variety of other contexts to explain changes in a continuous numeric variable between two or more conditions/groups. This vignette provides details regarding the use of postNet, and demonstrates typical workflows and results interpretation.
