\usage{
retrieveFormatData(source, version = NULL, species = NULL, customFile = NULL, fastaFile = NULL, posFile = NULL, rna_gbff_file = NULL, rna_fa_file = NULL, genomic_gff_file = NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{source}{Select the source of the reference sequences. There are five options to choose from: 'load' (default), 'custom', 'create', 'createFromFiles', and 'createFromSourceFiles'. The default option 'load' involves using pre-existing versions. However, you can also prepare references based on the latest version of NCBI RefSeq by selecting the 'create' option, which will automatically download the required files from the database. If you encounter issues with automatic downloads or do not have an internet connection, choose 'createFromSourceFiles' and download the required files separately (i.e., rna_gbff_file, rna_fa_file, and genomic_gff_file). Additionally, 'createFromFiles' allows you to use a custom fastaFile with reference sequences and a posFile in the format: transcriptID, utr5_stop, cds_stop, total_length. All these options are currently available only for the 'human' or 'mouse' species. Lastly, the 'custom' option lets you use a pre-prepared file, avoiding the use of the NCBI RefSeq database. The customFile must be in the format transcriptID, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq.}

\item{version}{Specify which pre-prepared NCBI RefSeq releases to load. You can use the function checkAvailableVersions to check available versions for a given species. If left as NULL, the function will automatically search for the most recent version.}

\item{species}{Select the species of interest. This argument is required unless the source option is 'custom'. Currently, only 'human' and 'mouse' are supported.}

\item{customFile}{Name of a file including a path to the customFile. The customFile must be in the format transcriptID, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq. This argument is only required if the source is 'custom'.}

\item{fastaFile}{Name of a file, including the path to the fastaFile with reference sequences. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromFiles'.}

\item{posFile}{Name of a file, including the path to the posFile. The file must be in the format: transcriptID, utr5_stop, cds_stop, total_length. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromFiles'.}

\item{rna_gbff_file}{Name of a file, including the path to the rna_gbff_file. It can be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromSourceFiles'.}

\item{rna_fa_file}{Name of a file, including the path to the rna_fa_file. It can be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromSourceFiles'.}

\item{genomic_gff_file}{Name of a file, including the path to the genomic_gff_file. It can be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromSourceFiles'.}
}

\value{
A data.frame in the format: id, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq.
}

\description{
The `retrieveFormatData` function is used to retrieve and format reference sequences, a crucial step in the anota2seqUtils analysis. It relies on the NCBI RefSeq database for reference sequence information, but it also offers a custom option to use with any database for any species. The function prepares annotation in the format, transcriptID, geneID, and 5'UTR, CDS, and 3'UTR sequences.

\examples{
# Optionally, check available versions for the 'human' species
checkAvailableVersions(species = 'human')

# Load pre-existing reference sequences for the 'human' species
annot <- retrieveFormatData(source = 'load', version = 'rel_109.20201120', species = 'human')
