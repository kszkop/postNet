\title{Comparisons of lengths}

\usage{
lengthAnalysis(a2sU, region, comparisons=NULL, plotOut = TRUE, plotType = "boxplot", pdfName = NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{a2sU}{ anota2seqUtils class object created using anota2seqUtilsStart function }
\item{region}{ Select the regions of interest. Choose from combination of "UTR5", "CDS", "UTR3" }
\item{comparisons}{ Indicate which regulation/geneList pairs should be compared. It should be provided as a list of vectors with pairs of indexes in regulation/geneList (for example list(c(0,2),c(2,4)) would indicate that the background (0) would be compared to the second and the second to the fourth mode of regulation/geneList. }
\item{plotOut}{ Logical whether plots and optionally comparisons should be performed. The default is TRUE. }
\item{plotType}{ If plotOut is TRUE, please indicate the type of the output plots (Choose from "boxplot", "violin", "ecdf"). The default is "boxplot". }
\item{pdfName}{ Name of the output pdf files. }
}

\value{
List of vectors for selected regions with calculated lengths for each gene. The function will also output plots with desired comparisons.
}

\description{
Lengths of desired regions for each gene is calculated. If plotOut is TRUE, all indicated comparisons between different sets of genes are performed and plotted. 
}

\examples{
#First prepare anota2seqUtils class object
# from anota2seq object
a2sU <- anota2seqUtilsStart(ads = anota2seqOutput, regulation =  c("translationUp","translationDown"), contrast = c(1,1), regulationGen = "translation", contrastSel = 1, region = c("UTR5","CDS","UTR3"), selection ="random", source = 'load', species = 'human')
# or from geneList
a2sU <- anota2seqUtilsStart(geneList = inList, geneListcolours=c("#F2A104","#00743F"), effectMeasure = quantIn, region = c("UTR5","CDS","UTR3"), selection ="random", comparisons = list(c(0,1),c(0,2),c(1,2)),plotType = "boxplot")


len_utr5 <- lengthAnalysis(a2sU = a2sU, region = c("UTR5","CDS","UTR3"), comparisons = list(c(0,1),c(0,2),c(1,2)),plotType = "boxplot")
