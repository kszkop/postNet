\title{Utility package for ribosome profiling}
\usage{
riboUtils(annot, fastaFile, path=NULL, runRust=TRUE, name=NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{annot}{ An object containing reference sequences is obtained by the retrieveFormatData function. It is data.frame in format: id, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq. id  column must contain the same type of transcript ids as reference sequences fasta files to which the ribosomal profiling data was aligned to. }
\item{path}{ Path to the bam files if not in working directory. }
\item{runRust}{  }
\item{fastaFile}{ Name of a fasta file including a path to the fastaFile with reference sequences.  It is only required if the source is 'createFromFiles'. }
\item{pdfName}{ Name of the output pdf files. }
}

\value{
Firstly count table per gene of ribosome footprints in coding region is provided. Furthermore, positions of all footprints per sample are provided in dpn format (id ZZZ postion ZZZ expression). Finally for each sample QC outputs are provided (riboWaltz and rust if desired)
}

\examples{
# Prepare annotation
annot <- retrieveFormatData(source='createFromFiles', fastaFile=fastaFile , posFile=posFile, species = 'human')
#Run riboUtils
riboUtils(annot=annot, fastaFile= 'ReferenceSeq.fa', path='.', runRust=TRUE)
