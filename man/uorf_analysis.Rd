\title{ Presence of uORFs estimation }

\usage{
uorf_analysis(a2sU, startCodon="ATG", KozakContext="strong", onlyUTR5=FALSE, unitOut="number", comparisons=NULL, plotOut = TRUE, pdfName = NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{a2sU}{ anota2seqUtils class object created using anota2seqUtilsStart function }
\item{startCodon}{ Select start codon. The default is canonical start codon "ATG". }
\item{KozakContext}{ Select Kozak Context. The default is strong (i.e [AG]..startCodonG). Alternatively, there are options to choose "adequate1" ([AG]..startCodon.) or "adequate2" (...startCodonG) or "weak" (...startCodon.). If "any" is selected, the nucleotide context of the start codon is disregarded. }
\item{onlyUTR5}{ Select whether the uORFs should be completely contained in the 5"UTR (ie start and stop codon). The default is FALSE, indicating that only the start codon should be in 5"UTR but with the possibility of having a stop codon in CDS or 3"UTR. }
\item{unitOut}{ Select whether the output should be a "number" of uORFs. It will be output as a vector and can be directly fed into feature integration step or "position". In that case list of uORFs positions per gene with be provided. The default is "number". }
\item{comparisons}{ Indicate which regulation/geneList pairs should be compared. It should be provided as a list of vectors with pairs of indexes in regulation/geneList (for example list(c(0,2),c(2,4)) would indicate that the background (0) would be compared to the second and the second to the fourth mode of regulation/geneList. If both regulation and geneList are provided, geneList is appended to the end. }
\item{plotOut}{ Logical whether plots and optionally comparisons should be performed. The default is TRUE. }
\item{pdfName}{ Name of the output pdf files. }
}

\value{
If the "number" of uORFs is selected, a list of vector with calculated values for each gene with be provided. It can be directly fed to the featureIntegration function. Otherwise, if the "position" list of uORF positions per gene. The function will also output plots with desired comparisons.
}

\description{
Presence of uORFs with desired start codon in given Kozak context is calculated. If plotOut is TRUE, all indicated comparisons between different sets of genes are performed and plotted.

#First prepare anota2seqUtils class object
