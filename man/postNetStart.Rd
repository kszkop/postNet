postNetStart(ads = NULL, regulation = NULL, contrast = NULL, regulationGen = NULL, contrastSel = NULL, geneList = NULL, geneListcolours = NULL, customBg = NULL, effectMeasure=NULL, selection = "random", source, version = NULL, species = NULL, customFile = NULL, fastaFile = NULL, posFile = NULL, rna_gbff_file = NULL, rna_fa_file = NULL, genomic_gff_file = NULL,adjObj = NULL,region_adj = NULL,excl = FALSE, keepAll = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{ads}{ An anota2seq object (an S4 object that is the output of the anota2seqRun function from the anota2seq package. See vignette for details). }
\item{regulation}{ If an anota2seq object is provided, provide the names of the regulatory modes that are to be compared as a vector. The possible choices are: "translationUp", "translationDown", "translatedmRNAUp", "translatedmRNAUp", "bufferingmRNAUp", "bufferingmRNADown", "mRNAAbundanceUp", "mRNAAbundanceDown", "totalmRNAUp", "totalmRNADown". }
\item{contrast}{ If the anota2seq object is provided and regulation modes selected, an indication of respective contrasts in the anota2seq object for each selected regulation mode (for example c(1,1,2) would indicate that the first two modes of regulation provided above are from contrast 1 and the third one from contrast 2). }
\item{regulationGen}{ Desired name of regulation from the anota2seq. Choose from "translation", "buffering", "mRNAAbundance", "translatedmRNA", "totalmRNA" to extract effectMeasure from the anota2seq object.}
\item{contrastSel}{ contrast for mode of regulation in the anota2seq object to be analysed }
\item{geneList}{ Instead of the anota2seq object, selected genes of interest can be provided in form of a named list of vectors. }
\item{geneListcolours}{ If geneList is provided, please provide colours for each gene selection }
\item{customBg}{ There is an option to provide a custom set of background genes as a character vector. }
\item{effectMeasure}{ In case the anots2seq object is absent, own measure of changes.}
\item{selection}{ There are multiple isoforms for a given gene, In this option, it is decided which isoform is selected to represent the gene, whether the longest or the shortest for a given region will be taken into consideration or simply random one.  Choose from  "longest", "shortest", or "random". The default is "random". }
\item{source}{Select the source of the reference sequences. There are five options to choose from: 'load' (default), 'custom', 'create', 'createFromFasta', and 'createFromSourceFiles'. The default option 'load' involves using pre-existing versions. However, you can also prepare references based on the latest version of NCBI RefSeq by selecting the 'create' option, which will automatically download the required files from the database. If you encounter issues with automatic downloads or do not have an internet connection, choose 'createFromSourceFiles' and download the required files separately (i.e., rna_gbff_file, rna_fa_file, and genomic_gff_file). Additionally, 'createFromFasta' allows you to use a custom fastaFile with reference sequences and a posFile in the format: transcriptID, utr5_stop, cds_stop, total_length. All these options are currently available only for the 'human' or 'mouse' species. Lastly, the 'custom' option lets you use a pre-prepared file, avoiding the use of the NCBI RefSeq database. The customFile must be in the format transcriptID, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq.}
\item{version}{Specify which pre-prepared NCBI RefSeq releases to load. You can use the function checkAvailableVersions to check available versions for a given species. If left as NULL, the function will automatically search for the most recent version.}
\item{species}{Select the species of interest. This argument is required unless the source option is 'custom'. Currently, only 'human' and 'mouse' are supported.}
\item{customFile}{Name of a file including a path to the customFile. The customFile must be in the format transcriptID, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq. This argument is only required if the source is 'custom'.}
\item{fastaFile}{Name of a file, including the path to the fastaFile with reference sequences. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromFasta'.}
\item{posFile}{Name of a file, including the path to the posFile. The file must be in the format: transcriptID, utr5_stop, cds_stop, total_length. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromFasta'.}
\item{rna_gbff_file}{Name and file path to the rna_gbff_file. This reference file can can be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. Note that the file should be compressed with gzip (.gz extension), which is the default format for NCBI RefSeq downloads. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromSourceFiles'.}
\item{rna_fa_file}{Name and file path to the rna_fa_file. This reference file can can be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. Note that the file should be compressed with gzip (.gz extension), which is the default format for NCBI RefSeq downloads. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromSourceFiles'.}
\item{genomic_gff_file}{Name and file path to the genomic_gff_file. This reference file can can be downloaded from NCBI RefSeq. Note that the file should be compressed with gzip (.gz extension), which is the default format for NCBI RefSeq downloads. This argument is only required if the source is 'createFromSourceFiles'.}
\item{adjObj}{ It should be a names list for UTR5 and/or UTR3 of named vector of sequences (with transcripts ids as names)}
\item{region_adj}{ UTR to be adjusted: UTR5 and/or UTR3 }
\item{excl}{ It keeps all genes/isoforms. If TRUE it will exclude genes/isoforms that are not in adjObj. The default is FALSE }
\item{keepAll}{ For transcripts that have multiple isoforms, remove these for a given gene that does not have information about sequences in adjObj. The idea is to have only adjusted sequences for these genes when there is "better" information and not from the database. Alternatively if TRUE it will also keep not adjusted isoforms for these genes alongside adjusted. The default is FALSE. }
}

\value{
S4 class object with information about selected species and version of the refseq annotation retrieved. The object also contain all the required gene selection inputs.
}

\description{
The `postNetStart` function is used to retrieve and format reference sequences, a crucial step in the postNet analysis. It relies on the NCBI RefSeq database for reference sequence information, but it also offers a custom option to use with any database for any species. The function prepares annotation in the format, transcriptID, geneID and sequence for each region 5'UTR, CDS, and 3'UTR sequences. Quite often there is much more precise information about 5" and 3" UTRs available. There is an option to replace UTR sequences in an annotation with reference sequences with the ones provided by the user in adjObj for available transcripts. In addition, the S4 object is created that is used for all the downstream analysis.
