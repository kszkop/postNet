\title{Adjust reference UTR sequences}

\usage{
adjustSeq(annot, adjObj, region_adj, excl = FALSE, keepAll = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{annot}{ An object containing reference sequences obtained by retrieveFormatData function. It is data.frame in format: id, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq.  }
\item{adjObj}{ It should be simply data.frame object with transcripts ids in the first column and adjusted 5"UTR or 3"UTR sequences in the second. }
\item{region_adj}{ UTR to be adjusted: UTR5 or UTR3 }
\item{excl}{ It keeps all genes/isoforms. If TRUE it will exclude genes/isoforms that are not in adjObj. The default is FALSE }
\item{keepAll}{ For transcripts that have multiple isoforms, remove these for a given gene that does not have information about sequences in adjObj. The idea is to have only adjusted sequences for these genes when there is "better" information and not from the database. Alternatively if TRUE it will also keep not adjusted isoforms for these genes alongside adjusted. The default is FALSE. }
}

\value{
Similar object to the annot, i.e. data.frame in format: id, geneID, UTR5_seq, CDS_seq, UTR3_seq , but with adjusted sequences
}

\description{
Quite often there is much more precise information about 5" and 3" UTRs available. This function replaces UTR sequences in an annotation with reference sequences with the ones provided by the user in adjObj for available transcripts.

\examples{
# Check available versions
checkAvailableVersions(species = "human")
# Load pre-existing reference sequences
annot <- retrieveFormatData(source="load", version="rel_109.20201120",species = "human")

# Adjust sequences
newSequences <- data.frame(id=c("NM_000014","NM_000015","NM_000016"),sequence=c("ACTGGGG","GGACTT","TTAACCCC"))
annot_adj <- adjustSeq(annot=annot, adjObj=newSequences, region_adj="UTR5", excl = FALSE, keepAll = FALSE)
