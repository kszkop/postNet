\usage{
featureIntegration(features, analysis_type, comparisons = NULL, rmCat = NULL, regOnly=TRUE, allFeat=TRUE, covarFilt = 20,  NetModelSel= "Omnibus", ads = NULL, regulationGen=NULL, contrastSel=NULL, geneList = NULL, geneListcolours=NULL, customBg = NULL, effectMeasure=NULL, outDir=NULL, pdfName=NULL)
}

\arguments{
\item{features}{ Named list of features. Each entry in the list is a vector with "quantified" feature at each step of the analysis. }
\item{analysis_type}{ Method for the analysis. Choose "lm" for stepwise linear model or "rf" random forest based analysis }
\item{rmCat}{ Relevant for random forest only. Please indicate genes from the regulatioh/geneList should be categorised. it should be provided as a vector c(1,2). 0 would indicate background genes. }
\item{comparisons}{ Relevant for linear model only (analysis_type="lm") and if regulated genes are only considered (regOnly=TRUE). Indicate which regulation/geneList pairs should be compared. It should be provided as a list of vectors with pairs of indexes in regulation/geneList (for example list(c(0,2),c(2,4)) would indicate that the background (0) would be compared to the second and the second to the fourth mode of regulation/geneList. If both regulation and geneList are provided, geneList is appended to the end. }
\item{regOnly}{ Logical, whether only regulated genes should be considered for the analysis or all expressed. The default is TRUE. }
\item{allFeat}{ If the analysis_type is "lm". Please select whether all features from input should be selected for the stepwise linear model or only these that passed 0.05 fdr threshold in the step of univariate models. The default is TRUE.}
\item{covarFilt}{ Minimum threshold for covariance between features to be dispayed for the network plot. The default is 20.  }
\item{NetModelSel}{ Values for the variance explained for the network plot. The default is "Omnibus". Aternatively "Adjusted" or "Univariate" can be provided. }
\item{ads}{ An anota2seq object (an output of anota2seqRun function from anota2seq package) }
\item{regulationGen}{ Desired name of regulation from the anota2seq. Choose from "translation", "buffering", "mRNAAbundance", "translatedmRNA", "totalmRNA". It is required even if regOnly is FALSE, to extract effectMeasure from the anota2seq object.
}
\item{contrastSel}{ contrast in the anota2seq object to be analysed }
\item{geneList}{ In addition or instead of the anota2seq object, selected genes of interest can be provided in form of a named list of vectors. }
\item{geneListcolours}{ If geneList is provided, please provide colours for each gene selection }
\item{customBg}{ There is an option to provide a custom set of background genes as a character vector. }
\item{effectMeasure}{ In case the anots2seq object is absent or own measure is desired.}
\item{outDir}{ Optionally, the name of the output directory.}
\item{pdfName}{ Name of the output pdf files. }
