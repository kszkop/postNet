\title{ Anota2seq slope filtering }

\usage{
slopeFilt(ads, regulationGen, contrastSel, minSlope, maxSlope)
}


\arguments{
\item{ads}{ An anota2seq object (an output of anota2seqRun function from anota2seq package) }
\item{regulationGen}{ desired name of regulation from the anota2seq. Genes will be filtered out based on slope values calculated to the mode. Choose from "translation" or "buffering" }
\item{contrastSel}{ contrast in the anota2seq object to be analysed }
\item{minSlope}{ threshold for the max slope. For recommendations please looks at anota2seq vignette }
\item{maxSlope}{ threshold for the min slope.  For recommendations please looks at anota2seq vignette }
}

\value{
character vector with filter out genes
}

\description{
Filtering genes based on slopes calculated by anota2seq for translation and buffering.
}

\examples{
filtOutGenes <- slopeFilt(ads = anota2seqOutput, regulationGen="translation", contrastSel=1, minSlope=-1, maxSlope=2)
}
