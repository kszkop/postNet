\title{ Calculation of motif presence }

\usage{
contentMotifs(annot, motifsIn, seqType="dna", dist=1, min_score=47, unitOut="number", resid=FALSE, region, subregion=NULL, subregionSel=NULL, comparisons=NULL, plotOut = TRUE, outDir=NULL, pdfName = NULL )
}

\arguments{
\item{a2sU}{ anota2seqUtils class object created using anota2seqUtilsStart function }
\item{motifsIn}{ motif sequences to be analyzed. IUPAC code or [ ] can be used for ambiguities. Provide "G4" for g-quadruplexes. G-quadruplexes presence is predicted using pqsfinder package https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pqsfinder.html }
\item{seqType}{ Sequence type of the motif. Choose from dna, rna, or protein. The default is "dna". }
\item{dist}{ Minimal distance between motifs. The default is 1. }
\item{min_score}{ Threshold for the quality of the g-quadruplexes prediction. It is required for "G4" option. The default is 47. }
\item{unitOut}{ Select whether the output should be a "number" of uORFs. It will be output as a vector and can be directly fed into feature integration step or "position". In that case list of uORFs positions per gene with be provided. The default is "number". }
\item{resid}{ Residuals after correction for the length of the sequences should be used instead. It can be TRUE only if unitOut is "number". The default is FALSE.}
\item{region}{ Select the regions of interest. Choose from combination of "UTR5", "CDS", "UTR3" }
\item{subregion}{ Optionally it is possible to select a subregion by indicating a number of nucleotides from the start if positive or end if negative. }
\item{subregionSel}{ It is required if the subregion is provided. Choose whether the indicated subregion should be "select" or "exclude". }
\item{comparisons}{ Indicate which regulation/geneList pairs should be compared. It should be provided as a list of vectors with pairs of indexes in regulation/geneList (for example list(c(0,2),c(2,4)) would indicate that the background (0) would be compared to the second and the second to the fourth mode of regulation/geneList. If both regulation and geneList are provided, geneList is appended to the end. }
\item{plotOut}{ Logical whether plots and optionally comparisons should be performed. The default is TRUE. }
\item{outDir}{ Optionally, the name of the output directory for all the plots if plotOut is TRUE. }
\item{pdfName}{ Name of the output pdf files. }
}

\value{
List of vectors for selected regions with calculated number of motifs present for each gene. The function will also output plots with desired comparisons.
}

\description{
The number of motifs in the selected region for each gene is calculated. There is also an option to predict the presence of g-quadruplexes using the pqsfinder package https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/pqsfinder.html . If plotOut is TRUE, all indicated comparisons between different sets of genes are performed and plotted.
